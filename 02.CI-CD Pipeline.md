CI/CD
==

A process to take a code, package it up and
deploy it to a system that can be serverless, a VM, or a container.

CI/CD has 3 steps:

- CI – Continuous Integration
- CD – Continuous Delivery
- CD – Continuous Deployment

## Continuous Integration

- A process in which the code is
merged from multiple contributors and added to a single repository.

- Key Processes of Continuous Integration: 
    - Package up the code
    - Test the code (run unit tests, integration tests, etc)
    - Run security checks against the code

## Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment

- In Continuous Delivery, to deploy the code after the CI process you have to manually trigger it via some button to deploy on the
system.

- In Continuous Deployment, the deployment is automatic.

- Key Pieces of Continuous Deployment:
    - Ensure you're authenticated to the system or wherever you're deploying
    - Ensure that the code that's being deployed is working as expected once it's deployed
