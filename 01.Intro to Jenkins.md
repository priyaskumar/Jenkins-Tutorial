Jenkins
==

- The most popular automation tool used worldwide for continuous integration and continuous delivery.

- Jenkins is a free and open-source automation server that enables developers to build, integrate and test code automatically as soon as it is committed to the source repository.

## Challenges faced by developers :

When working on a project with different teams, developers often face issues with different teams using different CI tools, version management, and other tools.

Setting up a CI/CD toolchain for each new project will lead to certain challenges like:

- Slower releases

- Manual Builds

- Non repeatable processes

- No automations

## Features of Jenkins

- Automated Builds

- Automated tests

- Automated CI/CD pipelines

- Automated deployments

- Ability to install jenkins locally

- Jenkins support and plugins

## Installing Jenkins in a VM and getting started

- SSH into the server 

- Install the prerequisite - JAVA

    ```
    sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
    ```

- Add the jenkins repository key to the system

    ```
    wget -q -0 - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable sudo apt-key add -
    ```

- Append the jenkins respository to server source list (add it to package manager)

    ```
    sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debain/etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
    ```

- Update all packages so that jenkins is embedded into it

    ```
    sudo apt update -y
    ```

    ```
    sudo ufw allow 8080
    ```

- Add password to the server in order to unlock jenkins from UI - copy paste the result (admin password) in UI.

    ```
    sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initailAdminPassword
    ```

    Server is now officially up and running
